injury inflicted on him by his ungrateful country
' with the submission he ought.” Themistocles, for
the reasons assigned in the text, being sentenced to

tion among the Athenione, called astraei-em, entered
into the service of Artaxerxes, whose formidable
armaments against the Grecian states he had some
years before totally overthrown at the famous battle
of Salamis. Although Cicero ·positively asserts that

selves by their own hands, yet the disagreement
of historians upon these points has lest the facts alto-
gether uncertain.

the signs of the times, Ι am not certain that this out-
rage (i. e. taking up a‘rms against one’s munh-y under

be committed? An allusion is evidently intended
here to the partisans of Julius Caesar.
