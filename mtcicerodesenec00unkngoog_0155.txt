come before him in hh judicial capacity? says
Cicero, “ he is no longer to consider himself in the
character of a ,fi-tend, but of a magistrate, who is
solemnly sworn to give sentence according to evi-
dence3 and the only favor he can justifiably show,
is to appoint the trial, in consequence of the discre-
tionary power with which he is invested by the
lawe, at the time which may be most convenient to
his friend. But when he appears as an advocate,
he is under much less* restraint. He may support
the cause of his friend, provided his crime be not
of a very atrocious nature, vvithout any impeach-
ment of his own integrity3 and in this he acts agree-
ably, not only to the glanem] practice and expectation
of the world, but to the common dictates of human-
ity.· The judge‚ indeed, must strictly end invariably
be governed by truth‚ as far as he can discover it, in
every question that comes before him3 but the advo-
cate may be permitted to give a plausible coloring
to the fiict in charge, and place it in the most advan-
tageoug though it should not be in its proper light.
And this is a doctrine,” continues Cicero, “ which
1 would not venture to advance, especially in a
treatise on ethics, if Ι were not supported in it by
the authority of PanaetiuS, one of the most judicious
and respectable writers among the Stoic philoso-
phers.” Cicero acted agreeably to this doctrine in
his defence of Milo, as he knew it was Milo’s inten-
tion to kill Clodius, if he met him on his way to
Lanuvium.
