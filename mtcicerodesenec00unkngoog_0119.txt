morse. ‘1 13

Cincius, one of the tribunes of the people, in order
to correct this abuse, proposed the law here men-
tioned3 and h'e was supported in his motion by
“ Fabius Maximus

13. 1. Cunctando .· ‘⁴ by wise delay.” Fabius
Maximus, in his contests against Hannibal, did not

fight in, the open field, like his predecessore, but
continually harassed his enemy by countermarches

and ambuscades, for which he received the surname
of Cunctator-the Delayer.

13. 8. Tarentum recepisti. Salinator commanded
in Tarentum when the troops of Hannibal gained
possession of the town; upon which he retired to
the citadel, and .gallantly defended it, until the city
was retaken by Fabius.

13. 21. Est in manibus laudatio .· ‘⁶ his pane-
gyric is in the hands of all.” The speech men·
tioned here was extant in the days of Plutarch, and
is still read and admired as a perfect model and
masterpiece of Roman eloquence. It was cus·
tomary at the funerals of illustrious pemons, for
the nearest relation to speak an oration in honor
of the deceased. This practice, as several of the
Roman writers complain, tended very much to
corrupt the truth of history, as these panegyricS,
which frequently imputed virtues and actions to
the object of them which never existed, were
too osten reson-ted to by historiens as faithful docu-

ments and memoirs. Cic. in Brut. Liv. viii. 40.
