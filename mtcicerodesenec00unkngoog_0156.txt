We must not be guilty of an infamous action to
benefit our ffiendS, for that would bring upon us the
contempt of mankind, and we should be injured
more than our friends would be profited.

volving but a small sum of money.”

87. 26. anue . . . . ver-saum. Epaminondas and
Pelopidas may be considered among the rare in-
stannes here mentioned. There is nothing, indeed,
more to be admired in the character of these illus-
trious supports and ornaments of the Theban com-
monwealth, than that perfect union and constant
friendship which subsisted between them during
their joint direction of public affairs both in peace
and war. If we shall observe‚ says Plutarch, what
happened in the same situation between Aristides
and Themistocles, Cimon and Pericles, Nicias and
Alcibiades, we shall find their administrations fun
of tumult, contentious, and disputes.

88. 2. Calamitoaeum societates .· “ a participation
in the calamities of others.”
